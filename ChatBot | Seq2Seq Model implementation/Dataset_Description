This dataset has MetaData and Real Data-

Let's understand the difference between MetaData and Real Data.

**Meta Data Will not be used for Training**, Meta data is some kind of descriptional data and ofcrouse we do not need that.


There are few files in the dataset like Movie Lines and novie conversations. 

In Movie lines text file, We have Chracter names, Movies name, lines spoken by those chracters etc. columns

Note :- It is very important to understand the Structure of the Data before you begin with your ChatBot project

Other text file "Movie conversation" in the dataset has separated the conversations belonging to one movie.
