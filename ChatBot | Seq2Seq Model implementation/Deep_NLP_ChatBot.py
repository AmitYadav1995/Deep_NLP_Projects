""" The Dataset I will be using here for this Project is a movie dataset containing

Thousands of conversation from these movies




Description of the dataset : -

This corpus contains a large metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts:



- 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters

- involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies

- in total 304,713 utterances

- movie metadata included:

    - genres

    - release year

    - IMDB rating

    - number of IMDB votes

    - IMDB rating

- character metadata included:

    - gender (for 3,774 characters)

    - position on movie credits (3,321 characters)


This dataset has MetaData and Real Data-

Let's understand the difference between MetaData and Real Data.

**Meta Data Will not be used for Training**, Meta data is some kind of descriptional data and ofcrouse we do not need that.


There are few files in the dataset like Movie Lines and novie conversations. 

In Movie lines text file, We have Chracter names, Movies name, lines spoken by those chracters etc. columns

Note :- It is very important to understand the Structure of the Data before you begin with your ChatBot project

Other text file "Movie conversation" in the dataset has separated the conversations belonging to one movie.

Encoding - If there is encoding issue you can use this arguement, I check my file and it has encoding issue hence will use this parameter

So What is this format for target-

1. It must be in batches (RNN or LSTM won't accept a single target')

Here What do we need to care for?- We need to make sure every sentence in the answers must start with SOS tokens, We can see

our dataset, We have seen that Our answers does not start with SOS tokens hence Need to add SOS tokens in them.

I will add it in the beginning of each answers and each tokens. 

hOW to Add this SOS token at the beggining of each answers

another statement for thsi function will be right side which is all the answers in the batch except the last one

Will use a tensorflow function in this strided_slice- Let's understand what this function is gonna do

It extracts a subset of tensors. Will extract everything except the last column.

It accepts these arguments

Input = It is your target variable
begin = It will accept the values where from you want to start the extraction
end = It will accept the value you want to end.

slide = Means by how many cells we want to slides when doing the extractions,

Since we want to get all of them except last one hence will give [1,1]

Now Will use pre-process statement  which accepts function "Concat" 

concat accepts values and axis 

If You want to make concatination horizantally Concatination will be 1 
But if you want to make concatination vertically, concatination will be zero


Here We want to make hormizontal concatination, Hence axis= 1
